**Website inaccessibility reasons:** IPv6 or DNS misconfiguration

We recently noticed that [pernambuco.com](http://pernambuco.com), a
regional news portal, has not been reachable from several networks in Brazil for quite some
time. By looking at [OONI data](/post/not-quite-network-censorship/measurements.br.pernambuco.csv), we found that the site was not reachable and that it presented signs of [DNS-based
blocking](https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/s3YPvS70pxtUQXG5qLv8z2wfafZ98eUzCmxcbYkvSRELpYS2mBWksZCacvAr5GqS?input=http:%2F%2Fwww.pernambuco.com%2Fdiario)
due to empty DNS responses that is usually a symptom of potential internet censorship. But upon further analysis, we found a number of DNS
misconfigurations of the nameservers hosting the domain in question. A
[nameserver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server) is a function of a DNS server that implements a
network service for providing responses to queries against a directory service.
In this article we present an analysis of possible DNS misconfigurations that
may have caused `pernambuco.com` to be inaccessible. We also provide some
solutions to resolve DNS misconfiguration for `pernambuco.com` and other sites potentially affected in Brazil and worldwide.

OONI tries hard to apply [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) to every statement about network
interference: *never attribute to censorship that which is adequately explained
by misconfiguration*. Thanks to Lucas from [CodingRights](https://www.codingrights.org/) who gave us access to
his networks, the numerous [OONI measurements](https://api.ooni.io/files/by_country/BR) submitted by
volunteers and RIPE Atlas measurements, we were able to investigate the inaccessibility of
[pernambuco.com](http://pernambuco.com) in Brazil.

## DNS resolution failures

The basic issue that we identified is that the [recursive DNS nameserver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Recursive_and_caching_name_server)
provided by [Virtua ISP](https://stat.ripe.net/AS28573) failed to resolve the
domain, responding with `SERVFAIL` (`Server failure`) meaning that "*the name
server was unable to process this query due to a problem with the name
server*" according to [RFC1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035).

Below we include the output of the DNS lookup utility `dig` querying the domain name
`pernambuco.com`:

<details><summary>`$ dig pernambuco.com`</summary>
<pre><code>

;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:

</code></pre></details>

One of the ways to check if the domain is blocked by some local DNS policy is
to attempt to resolve it directly through an [authoritative nameserver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Authoritative_name_server).
If DNS name resolution works that way, it suggests that the case could be some
misconfiguration and not a case of DNS-based filtering. And `pernambuco.com`
passed the test:

<details><summary>`$ dig +trace pernambuco.com`</summary>

While checking various resolution paths we discovered that `ns2.upx.com.br`,
resolving to the IPv6 address `2001:19f0:ac01:b3:5400:ff:fe46:4676`, was not
responding to DNS queries. The first assumption we made was that the recursive
DNS nameserver has a strong preference for IPv6 over IPv4 and fails fast if the
IPv6 endpoint is not reachable. However, the resource `ns1.upx.com.br` had an
IPv6 address, so we assumed that there is something special about the resource
`ns2.upx.com.br` and found that it was the only authoritative nameserver
with an IPv6
[glue record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Circular_dependencies_and_glue_records)
in the top-level domain zone.

Through [RIPE Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net) measurements, we verified that `ns2.upx.com.br` works without
errors through IPv4 via
[DNS/TCP](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10197953/#!probes), but is broken
through IPv6 both via
[DNS/UDP](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10197871/#!probes) and
[DNS/TCP](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10197872/#!probes).

We got in touch with [UPX Technologies](https://www.upx.com/), the service provider of the aforementioned DNS
nameserver, and reported the issue. The
technical support team was very collaborative and quickly resolved the issue of
IPv6 connectivity for
[DNS/TCP](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10199076/#!probes) and
[DNS/UDP](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10199080/#!probes). We appreciate
the amount of cooperation and support that we received from the UPX team, even though we are not
their customers.

Unfortunately though, the recursive DNS nameserver still responds with the
<tt>SERVFAIL</tt> error code and the issue [affects many Brazilian
networks](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10203306/?filter=&diversity-picker=5&aggregator=&show_only=SERVFAIL#!map), but not
all of them. This strongly suggests that it *may* be a
misconfiguration issue, rather than a network filtering policy. In addition to Brazilian networks, this
issue also appears to be affecting a number of other
[networks worldwide](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10203314/?filter=&diversity-picker=5&aggregator=&show_only=SERVFAIL#!map) and
the [failure was cached](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10204036/#!probes)
according to consequent resolution latency.

![RIPE Atlas measurement showing worldwide failures](/post/not-quite-network-censorship/ripe-atlas-10203314.png)

Other affected domains include
[`aquipe.com.br`](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10204359/#!probes),
[`assineodiario.com.br`](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10294525/#!probes),
[`brunoprado.com.br`](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10294526/#!probes),
[`clubediario.com.br`](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10294527/#!probes),
[`espacodaprevidencia.com.br`](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10294528/#!probes),
[`radiogloborecife.com.br`](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10294529/#!probes),
[`tvonorte.com.br`](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10294531/#!probes) and
[`wakeworld.com.br`](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10294532/#!probes). All of these domains present the same
failure and symptoms. But some other domains "hosted" by UPX Technologies were
not affected, such as [`dpnet.com.br`](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10204294/#!probes) and
the resource [`upx.com.br`](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10203916/#!general).

Most of the affected domains listed above look like stale, "dead" websites, while only two of them seem "active". 
What is common amongst the failing domains (SERVFAIL response code) is the
difference between the `NS` records at the top-level domain nameserver and the
authoritative nameserver that was clearly visible in the trace of the
delegation path from the root name servers; `dig +trace`.

## NS records pointing to a CNAME is a bad practice

The `NS` records of the affected domains are `americadonorte.upx.com.br` and
`americalatina.upx.com.br`. These records are `CNAME` records in the
`upx.com.br` zone and according to [RFC's 1912 common DNS errors
section](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1912#section-2.4) (dating back around
11 years ago): "*Having NS records pointing to a CNAME is bad and may conflict
badly with current BIND servers. In fact, current BIND implementations will
ignore such records, possibly leading to a lame delegation*".

Below we include a proof of concept to verify this issue in [BIND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND), the most widely used DNS server:

</code></pre></details>

## Workaround

We propose the following possible solutions to fix this issue:

* To access an affected site, use any of the [public recursive name servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_recursive_name_server), except for OpenNIC (which announces the usage of BIND 9.10.x via `version.bind/CH/TXT` DNS resource record and can't resolve the affected domain names);

* UPX may expand `americalatina.upx.com.br` and `americadonorte.upx.com.br` CNAMEs to `A` and `AAAA` records;

* The administrators of the affected sites can apply the following changes in the TLD registry control panel:

  * `americalatina.upx.com.br` should be replaced with `ns1.upx.com.br`;
  * `americadonorte.upx.com.br` → `ns2.upx.com.br`;
  * `asia.upx.com.br` → `ns3.upx.com.br`.

## Responsible disclosure

On 15th November 2017 we reported the issue to UPX. As a result, they quickly resolved the IPv6 issue. They also explained that the CNAME incident was a fix for some operational issues and that they were aware that this could potentially break backward compatibility. UPX assured us that the affected customers
were notified about the migration to new NS names a long time ago.

UPX also advised us to notify the administrators of the affected websites,
pointing them to UPX customer service to avoid potential trust issues. We
notified the administrators of the affected "active" websites on 23rd November 2017, but
some of these email notifications [bounced back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_message).

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

We believe that the issue is indeed a misconfiguration and *not* an intentional, network filtering policy. We hope that this report will help others to troubleshoot and fix DNS misconfiguration affecting the accessibility of sites around the world.
