We first met [Moses Karanja](https://moseskaranja.com/) several years
ago at the [Citizen Lab Summer Institute](https://citizenlab.ca/summerinstitute/). He’s a Kenyan
information controls researcher, having previously worked with
Strathmore University Law School research centre,
[CIPIT](http://cipit.org/). Currently, he’s a PhD student at the
University of Toronto.

Over the last years, Moses has championed OONI community engagement
across Africa. Thanks to his tireless efforts, communities in many
African countries are now running [OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/) and using [OONI data](https://ooni.org/data/) to examine internet censorship
and other forms of network interference. We have worked with Moses on a
number of research reports and are grateful for his commitment to
defending a free and open internet.

Today we publish an interview with Moses so that you can have a chance
to meet him too and learn more about his work.

This is the first interview of a series of interviews with community
members that we’ll be publishing over the next weeks/months. [Subscribe to our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQhDgj9wBf4_w5bWFvLlq-w?sub_confirmation=1)
