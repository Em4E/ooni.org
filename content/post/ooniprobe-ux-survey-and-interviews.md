**[Survey](https://ooniuxteam.typeform.com/to/a1P0cn)** (self-hosted [mirror](https://storm.torproject.org/shared/VpAFK13fdAozTGTolFd2EsT1CkLY8-YlBLbRERy5EwI))

Since last year’s [launch of the OONI Probe mobile apps](https://ooni.org/post/ooni-mobile-app/), tens of
thousands of people have been [measuring internet censorship in around 200 countries](https://api.ooni.io/stats) every month. But [OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/) is far from perfect.

We’re excited to hear more about your experience with the apps so that
we can improve them.

We invite you to complete our survey and/or participate in an interview
to provide feedback.

# Survey

We’d love to hear your thoughts on the *current* OONI Probe mobile apps.

We’re particularly interested in learning about what you find most
challenging about OONI Probe, and whether you have any “wishlist”
features in mind that you would love to see in future OONI Probe
versions!

Please take a few minutes to complete our survey:

Alternatively, you can fill out the survey using Tor’s self-hosted
version of it:

# Interview

The OONI team is currently working on *revamping* the OONI Probe mobile
apps to improve their usability, design, and include some new features
based on community requests.

By participating in a **10-15 minute interview**, you can gain a sneak
peak into the *new* OONI Probe mobile apps and provide feedback on our
mockups.

If you’re interested in participating in these interviews, please notify
us via the above survey or send an email to
[maria@openobservatory.org](mailto:maria@openobservatory.org).

Thanks for your time. Your feedback will help us improve OONI Probe for
a global community!
