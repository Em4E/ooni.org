The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) team is happy to announce
the beta release of OONI Probe's distribution for Raspberry Pis, caÄºled
**Lepidopter**.

## What is Lepidopter

Lepidopter is a Raspberry Pi distribution image with all the required
dependencies and software packages in place, configured to run network
measurement tests via the
[OONI Probe](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe) software. It is
developed and designed to require no physical attendance upon first bootstrap
but also allows experienced users to further configure it as they wish. The
[source code](https://github.com/TheTorProject/lepidopter) and the building
scripts of the Lepidopter image are free and open source software.

## Why use Lepidopter

Since 2012 OONI has collected millions of network measurements that show
evidence of internet censorship and network tampering. OONI measurement data
[shows](/post/) how ISPs filter and censor the internet.
This wouldn't be possible without the help of numerous volunteers that are
contributing by running consistent OONI Probe network measurement tests from
different vantage points. Up to now users needed to be technically savvy to
maintain their own probes dealing with system configuration, software and
measurement specific updates. Lepidopter makes it easier for people that have a
Raspberry Pi and an SD card to be part of the OONI community and help us
reveal, publish and document possible instances of network interference
worldwide.

## How to obtain Lepidopter

Please refer to the [installation instructions](/install/lepidopter/) where
you can find a detailed guide on how to download, verify and install the latest
Lepidopter image for a Raspberry Pi.
