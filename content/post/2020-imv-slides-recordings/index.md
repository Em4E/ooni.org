Over the last month, between 10th June 2020 to 3rd July 2020, we
organized and hosted the **[Internet Measurement Village (IMV) 2020](https://ooni.org/post/2020-internet-measurement-village/)**, an
online community event aimed at sharing skills, knowledge, and resources
on internet measurement, in defense of a free and open internet.

As all the IMV sessions were live-streamed and will continue to live on
the [OONI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OONIorg), we hope
that these recordings will serve as a valuable resource on internet
measurement for the internet freedom community.

In this post, we share the slides and video recording of each IMV 2020
presentation.
