Over the last month, between 10th June 2020 to 3rd July 2020, we
organized and hosted the **[Internet Measurement Village (IMV) 2020](https://ooni.org/post/2020-internet-measurement-village/)**, an
online community event aimed at sharing skills, knowledge, and resources
on internet measurement, in defense of a free and open internet.

As all the IMV sessions were live-streamed and will continue to live on
the [OONI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OONIorg), we hope
that these recordings will serve as a valuable resource on internet
measurement for the internet freedom community.

In this post, we share the slides and video recording of each IMV 2020
presentation.

# IMV 2020 Recap

As part of the Internet Measurement Village (IMV), we **[live-streamed a total of 18 presentations](https://ooni.org/post/2020-internet-measurement-village/#schedule)**:
one presentation almost every day over four weeks.

The presentations featured various internet measurement projects, local
censorship measurement projects, advocacy efforts fighting internet
shutdowns, and censorship circumvention tool projects. We were honored
to be joined by many brilliant and passionate community members!

Each presentation was live-streamed on the [OONI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OONIorg), enabling anyone around the
world to tune in and participate. To encourage participation, we
facilitated chat discussions during each presentation on several
platforms (YouTube live chat, [Slack](https://slack.ooni.org/), IRC),
where we shared relevant resources and collected questions in a
[pad](https://pad.riseup.net/p/imv2020-keep) (where viewers also had
the option to contribute questions anonymously). We were amazed by the
level of participation! On average, each presenter received around 10
questions from the viewers.

Thanks to the lovely [Sandy Ordonez](https://www.opentech.fund/about/people/sandra-ordonez/), the
IMV also had an online social event! On 26th June 2020, Sandy hosted the
**[IMV 2020 Distance Disco](https://distancedisco.nl/)**, an online
dance party that provided participants an opportunity to meet and greet,
and dance their stress off!

At the end of the IMV 2020, we shared a
[survey](https://ooni.typeform.com/to/cPVT4ILB) (which we encourage
you to fill out, if you haven’t already!) to collect community feedback
and learn how we can host better events in the future.

Warm thanks to all IMV presenters for sharing their important work with
the community! Special thanks to everyone who tuned in, asked questions,
and shared resources.
