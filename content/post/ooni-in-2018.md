# New partnerships

Our network of partners grew significantly in 2018!

Throughout the year, we had the opportunity to establish 8 new
[partnerships](https://ooni.org/get-involved/partnership-program/)
with the following digital rights organizations:

* [Tuwindi Foundation](http://tuwindi.org/) (Mali)

* [Instituto Prensa y Sociedad (IPYS) Venezuela](https://ipysvenezuela.org/) (Venezuela)

With our growing coalition of more than 20 digital rights organizations,
we will continue to measure and report on internet censorship around the
world.

# Dev work behind the scenes

The [OONI software ecosystem](https://github.com/ooni) is quite big,
consisting of multiple different, but interdependent, software projects
(expanding beyond user-facing apps).

During 2018, OONI developers worked on improving upon and maintaining
existing software projects, in addition to creating new ones.

Below we list some of the exciting new software projects we expect to
launch in 2019!

## Revamped OONI Probe mobile app

Earlier this week, we [launched a revamped version of the OONI Probe mobile app](https://ooni.io/post/revamped-ooni-probe-mobile-app/)!

Since “a picture is worth a thousand words”, here’s a comparison of the
old vs. new app:

![OONI Probe Mobile: Old vs. New](/post/ooni-2018/ooni-app-comparison.png)

We spent most of 2018 revamping the OONI Probe mobile app to improve
its usability and include new features.

Ever since we [first launched the OONI Probe mobile app](https://ooni.org/post/ooni-mobile-app/) (back in
February 2017), we have been collecting community feedback on an ongoing
basis (through monthly community meetings, workshops, daily interactions
with partners, etc). To collect community feedback in a more structured
way, we:

* Carried out an in-person usability study in Kiev, Ukraine
(July 2018) with local community members

* Created and circulated an online
[survey](https://ooniuxteam.typeform.com/to/a1P0cn)

* [Interviewed](https://ooni.org/post/ooniprobe-ux-survey-and-interviews/)
more than 20 community members from around the world

The feedback that we collected and analyzed from the usability studies
informed the design and development of the OONI Probe mobile app. In
November 2018, we released the [public beta](https://github.com/ooni/translations/blob/master/Guidelines.md#install-the-ooni-probe-public-beta)
of the revamped app. 

You can now [install the stable version](https://ooni.org/install/).

## Revamped OONI Explorer

[OONI Explorer](https://explorer.ooni.io/) is likely the
largest, publicly-available, dataset on internet censorship to date.

Consisting of millions of network measurements collected from thousands
of networks from more than 200 countries since 2012, OONI Explorer
serves as a growing, public archive on network interference around the
world. But the current version of OONI Explorer could benefit from a
series of improvements (we have collected lots of community feedback on
this over the years).

To this end, we started working on revamping OONI Explorer entirely.

We are excited that **Sarath M S** joined the OONI team in
2018! He has since been developing the new and improved OONI Explorer.

We expect to launch the revamped version of OONI Explorer by mid-2019... so stay tuned!

## New OONI Probe desktop apps

In 2018, we started building OONI Probe desktop apps. 

These apps are a big step forward compared to the previously released [macOS and Linux web UI](https://ooni.org/post/web-ui-post/), as they feature a more native platform integration and will be supporting Windows computers as well.

Our aim is to ensure that OONI Probe is not only available on more platforms, but that it is also as easy to install and use as possible. 

We released a [beta version](https://github.com/ooni/probe-desktop/releases) of the OONI Probe desktop apps for Windows and macOS in 2018, and plan to launch the apps in 2019. 

## Probe Orchestration

We have been working on creating the [OONI Probe Orchestration System](https://github.com/ooni/orchestra) to
dynamically instrument the collection of OONI Probe measurements around
the world, particularly in response to emergent censorship events.

Throughout 2018, we made a fair amount of progress on implementing
unattended Probe Orchestration, which means that OONI Probe deployments
would be “smart enough” to know when it’s the right moment to run
certain tests.

The specification and design of Probe Orchestration received a security
audit and we are planning to roll it out in production in 2019.

# Videos

We started experimenting with the creation of videos! In 2018, we set up
an [OONI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQhDgj9wBf4_w5bWFvLlq-w),
where we published the following:

* **[ParkNet: Exploring Internet Censorship in Cuba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslsL84jx4E&t=2s)** (short
documentary on our [research](https://ooni.org/post/cuba-internet-censorship-2017/) in Cuba)

* **[Interview with Julie Owono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t842clfakt0)** (OONI Community Interview series)

* **[Interview with Moses Karanja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pam2UQoZ1qM)** (OONI Community Interview series)

We also interviewed many other community members and plan to publish
their interviews on our YouTube channel in 2019.

# Expanding OONI-verse

The OONI-verse expands beyond the projects that the core OONI team works
on.

For starters, projects like [OONI Explorer](https://explorer.ooni.io/) would not be possible without
the tens of thousands of community members who run OONI Probe every day,
contributing measurements to us and to the world.

In 2018, OONI Probe was run in around 210 countries every month,
covering more than 5,000 networks. This expanded coverage (in comparison
to previous years) is evident through our
[stats](https://api.ooni.io/stats):

![OONI Probe usage stats](/post/ooni-2018/ooni-2018-stats.png)

**We thank every single OONI Probe user out there.**

We are also excited to see communities take leadership, engaging their
local communities with OONI Probe and OONI data.

Malaysia’s [Sinar Project](https://sinarproject.org/), for example,
has been engaging journalists and human rights defenders across
Southeast Asia with censorship measurement research over the last years.
They recently organized and hosted the [OONI Southeast Asia Regional Workshop](https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/updates/open-observatory-of-network-interference-ooni-southeast-asia-regional-workshop),
engaging local communities from Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Thailand, and Vietnam with the use of OONI Probe and OONI data
(particularly within the context of election monitoring).

These initiatives help *decentralize OONI* and strengthen the global
fight against internet censorship. We hope to see more local community
initiatives in 2019!
