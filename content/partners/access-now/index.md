Since 2016, Access Now's #KeepItOn coalition — more than 220 organizations from 99 countries around the world — has been fighting internet shutdowns with all kinds of creative approaches, including grassroots advocacy, direct policy-maker engagement, technical support, and legal intervention.

OONI has been a member of the #KeepItOn campaign since 2016, supporting human rights advocates around the world with censorship measurement.
