Netalitica aims to improve the Citizen Labâ€™s [test lists](https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists) that network measurement tools (i.e. OONI Probe, Centinel) use to uncover blocking of websites. If network probes have evolved over the years, test lists for some countries and regions have seen little updates, which negatively affects the quality of collected measurements and wastes resources of testers on the ground. 

Netalitica's test list project aims to address these issues by updating the lists for select censorship hot spots around the world and advance recommendations for streamlining the process of updating lists. 

OONI collaborates with Netalitica on engaging researchers and reviewing updates to test lists.
