Coding Rights are an organisation bringing an intersectional feminist approach to defend human rights in the development, regulation and use of technologies. They act collectively and in networks, use creativity and hacker knowledge to question the present and reimagine a future based on transfeminist and decolonial values.

Their mission is to expose and challenge technologies which reinforce power asymmetries, with focus on gender inequalities and its intersectionalities.

Openness, transparency, diversity, equality, privacy and freedom in the access and usages of technologies and in the interaction with governance processes are at the core of the development of a people-centered network and a democratic society. Coding Rightsâ€™ projects are meant to cherish these values, empowering civil society, and particularly women from different fields across the globe, to promote a shift in the male lead environment of ICTs.
