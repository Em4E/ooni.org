Masaar are a group of lawyers and technologists interested in enhancing and
promoting digital rights and associated freedoms in Egypt. They focus on
merging law and technology and deepening their understanding of their impact on
human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Masaar's activities focus on digital freedoms in the context of the
Egyptian law, but that will not isolate Masaar from the human rights
situation in other countries in the region and the world. This
regional focus stems from the fact that surveillance and censorship
policies, restrictions on digital media and the denial of freedom of
information are concerns common to all countries in the Middle East
and North Africa. Also, countries in the region share certain economic
and political trends that contributed to the Arab Spring uprisings in
2011 and still inform people's protests today.
