Founded in January 2013, Open Net Korea is a non-profit organization that aims to provide a forum for discussion and collaboration to explore effective policies and solutions in the following areas: Freedom of Expression, Freedom from Surveillance, Reforming Innovation-blocking Regulations, Net Governance and Neutrality, Open Data Policy, and Reforming the Intellectual Property Regime.

Open Net Korea is aspiring to become not only a legal and legislative advocacy organization that fights the regulations, but also a think tank that inquires into the reasons for these regulations and “thinks aloud” with the Korean public and the world on what has caused and what will prevent the Internet from becoming a “closed” circuit for some group of people, instead of “open network”.
