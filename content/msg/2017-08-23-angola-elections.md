# Angolan Legislative Election 2017

Election day is an important day, but so are the days following an election.

You can actively examine whether and to what extent online information is accessible in Angola. By running ooniprobe, you can examine:

* Whether websites are blocked;
* Whether systems that could be responsible for censorship or surveillance are present in your network;
* Net neutrality violations.

Increasing transparency of information controls during political events is important! By running ooniprobe, you can do just that.
